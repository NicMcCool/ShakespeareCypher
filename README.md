Because it's dumb, and dumb is fun, and some people REALLY like odd stuff online...
This will break down a Shakespeare play by line, encode it, and then post to Telegram at random intervals. 

Why? Because, good without evil is like light without darkness which in turn is like righteousness with out hope.

Or; the web of our life is of a mingled yarn, good and ill together.
